# AI Usage Logging Rule

## Mandatory: Log AI Usage After Every Task

After completing any coding task in this repository, you MUST log your AI usage by running one of these commands:

### Option A — Automatic scanner (recommended)
```bash
python scripts/log_antigravity.py --auto
```
This automatically detects your current Antigravity session and logs it.

### Option B — Manual log
```bash
python scripts/log_manual.py --tool antigravity --prompt "<brief summary of what you did>"
```

## Why This Matters

This repository requires all team members to log their AI tool usage before pushing code.
The pre-push git hook will **block your push** if no AI logs are found.

By running the log command after each task, you ensure:
1. Your AI usage is properly tracked
2. Your git push won't be blocked
3. Team compliance with AI transparency requirements

## When To Log

- After completing a coding task
- After making significant code changes
- Before your session ends
- Before running `git push`
